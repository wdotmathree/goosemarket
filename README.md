# Labs

All SE101 labs will be kept within this project.  This project should be the
upstream for the students labs and then they can do a pull from the upstream to
get the latest lab.

Lab-1: Setting up Git, Python, Pip, Gcc, and doing basic git commands.

Lab-2: Some basic python, and python with single-table MySQL. Basic logging.
