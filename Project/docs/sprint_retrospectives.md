# Sprint Retrospectives

## Week 1

What went well:
We created a solid foundation for our project, including writing all documentation, setting up our database, and completing some of the frontend.

What can we improve:
Given that it was the first sprint, there were a lot of blocking tasks which made working concurrently a bit harder this week, but going forward we can make more independent tasks so that we can all work at the same time on different features.

## Week 2

What went well:
We were able to finish the backend functions for creating polls and tags, create admin panel functions, as well as finishing most of the frontend.
We were able to prioritize finishing the most important features of our project first.
We succesfully created tests that were able to replicate our database in order to test our flask functions.

What can we improve:
We can improve our planning a little bit so that our tasks are not blocking each other as much, as we were not able to integrate the frontend and backend together this week.

## Week 3

What went well:
We have been able to integrate much of our backend with our frontend, so the app is finally useable.
Everyone was able to work on backend tasks independently, we had no blocking tasks this week.
We created the math behind calculating share prices, and how they change as users buy and sell, which is the main feature of our site.

What can we improve:
We could have had more communication between the frontend and backend developers, as the expected JSON in the frontend does not always match
what the backend returns.
