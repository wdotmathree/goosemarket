# User Manual
GooseMarket is a prediction-market platform where users buy and sell shares in polls in attempt to predict campus events at the University of Waterloo.

## Sign Up
Users must provide a valid @uwaterloo.ca email address to create an account. They will be sent a verification email from GooseMarket, which they must click to verify their account.

Users must have a unique username.

## Making a Trade
To make a trade, users must navigate to that poll's associated page. This can be done either through the dashboard or by clicking on a poll in a user's profile.
If the poll is closed, users will not be allowed to make any trades on it, but they can still view the poll's page to view stats.
If the poll is open, make sure the "Buy" mode is activated, choose either yes or no, select how many shares you want to buy, and place your trade!

Once a trade is made on a poll, users will be able to see their current position on the poll on the right hand side of the poll, or on their profile page.

## Selling Shares
If the user currently has an open position in a poll, they are able to sell up to the amount of shares they own.
Note that prices will dynamically change as you begin to sell your shares, so you may not receive as much as you expect for selling (The correct amount is displayed under "Expected cost").

## Creating a poll
Users can navigate to the Create page to create a new poll.
Users must provide a valid title, description, and end date, and can optionally add relevant tags to their poll.
All polls will go into review when created, so they will not instantly show up on the dashboard. Once they are approved by an admin, users will be able to see their poll publicly.

## Profiles
Users can navigate to their own profile by clicking their profile image in the top right, then clicking "View Profile"
Users can view other users' profiles by navigating to the leaderboard page and selecting their desired user.
