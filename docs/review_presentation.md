# Review Presentation

## Increment
After week 1, we had set up our database, completed our planning documentation, created a backlog of tasks, and began work on the login page frontend.
After week 2, we finished most of the frontend, as well as creating some backend functions (creating polls and an admin panel to review polls)
After week 3, we finished every backend function, including the math behind setting market prices. We began to integrate the frontend and backend, but had some minor troubles with the frontend and backend being built independently, causing some small compatibility issues.
After week 4, we fully integrated the frontend and backend, fixing most bugs along the way. This was the first week we had a fully useable product where users could create polls and place bets, and admin could resolve polls to pay out users.
Week 5 was a very small sprint which included fixing minor bugs and completing the documentation for the project, as well as hosting it.

## Velocity
Across our 4 sprints, our velocity was 11->18->25->31
This indicates that we underestimated how long some features would take when planning how to divide the project into 4 weeks, so as a result, we had to do more work in the latter weeks to finish on time.

## Stakeholder feedback
Throughout our sprint reviews, we didn't ever receive any feedback from our reviewer, who was our only stakeholder.
