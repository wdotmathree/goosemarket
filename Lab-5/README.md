# Lab 5 Requirements

In Lab 5 we will starting into teamwork and the beginning of the project.  In
git you will see there is a new project

	Project Team <NN>
	
where <NN> is your team number.  You, and the rest of your team, have
Maintainer-level access in that project and full privileges on the MySQL
database `SE101_Team_<NN>`.  Both the project and the database are empty.  You
can find out who your team members are by looking there or on Learn.  Together
with the rest of your team, you should set the upstream of your project to

	ist-git@git.uwaterloo.ca:se101-fall2025/project.git

or

	https://git.uwaterloo.ca/se101-fall2025/project.git

whichever you prefer.  After fetching the upstream you should see a README in
that project telling you what is required of this lab and of the project.
